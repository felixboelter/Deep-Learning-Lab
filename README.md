# Deep Learning Lab

## [Assignment 4](https://github.com/felixboelter/Deep-Learning-Lab/blob/main/Assignment_4)
Implemented the Transformer sequence-to-sequence model to solve mathematical problems based on the [DeepMind Mathematics Dataset](https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_dataset) 
which includes three difficulties. A further review of the implementation, hyperparameter tuning, the training and validation losses and their respective accuracies can be seen in the [Report](https://github.com/felixboelter/Deep-Learning-Lab/blob/main/Assignment_4/Report/Assignment_4_Felix_Boelter.pdf).
